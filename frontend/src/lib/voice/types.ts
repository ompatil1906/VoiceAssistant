/* EMMA voice UI — shared types + transport contract.

   Two transports implement the same interface:

   * `gateway-transport` — live: streams the browser mic to the real
     `/ws/exotel` speech pipeline (Azure STT → controller → Azure TTS) and
     plays the returned PCM audio. It renders the gateway's own transcript,
     assistant text, and state control events.
   * `livekit-transport` — live: connects the browser mic to a LiveKit room
     running a LiveKit agent (Deepgram Flux STT → OpenAI GPT-6 Luna →
     controller → Qdrant RAG → NestJS backend → ElevenLabs TTS). Requires
     `VOICE_TRANSPORT=livekit` and LiveKit credentials on the gateway.
   * `demo-transport` — a clearly-labelled visual preview that walks the
     listening → thinking → speaking cycle with SAMPLE dialogue. It never
     pretends a real call or an AI conversation took place. */
